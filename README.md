# Important Note
I added commands to create tables including 1000 rows in .sql files. So you can create as many rows as you want up to 1000.
Also I added .csv files. If you want to just import tables and not create yourself, you can use .csv files.

If you want to know more about SQL and databases, plese visit my gitbook: https://app.gitbook.com/s/r0H8jR9rIsmhpZIBOtCD/
